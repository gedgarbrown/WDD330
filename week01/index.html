<h3> Notes: </h3>

<p> I am still having trouble with watching the videos on Sitepoint. I have purchased access in the bookstore and currently it 
appears taht the pruchase is still processing. <br>
The Localstorage for  Doing Stuff with Web Things was interesting. I imagine that the local storage is stored in the "cookies". 
It seems like this may be useful. I imagine this would be where preferences are set for a website. I'm sure we'll look at best practices 
concerning Local Storage coming up.

<p> Here is a link to the excercise I did following along with the reading.
